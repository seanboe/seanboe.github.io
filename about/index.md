### Who Am I?
Hi! I'm Sean Boerhout, and I'm a student at Westview High School. I really like to make stuff, so this blog is where I can share my creations, thoughts, or whatever else I feel like sharing. 

I am the president of Westview's Arduino Club, a club focused on allowing students to work on Arduino projects with their friends and learn with their peers.

### Dope Web! How'd You Make It???

I used Jekyll/Github Pages with the [Ghost/Jasper2](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2) layout. Creating this was easier than I thought and there isn't even a need to host it locally! Here's my [github repo](https://github.com/seanboe/blog/) in case you're wondering.
