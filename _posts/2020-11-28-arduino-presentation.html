<p>Over Thanksgiving break, I decided to put together a presentation displaying the basics of arduino programming 
  for people in my Arduino Club who are new to this. The club was approved a mere month ago, so it's time to get
  things rolling!
</p>

<p>This slideshow starts with the basics-what variables are + data types and what a byte is. It eventually progresses
  to structures and function definitions. I hope to also add some slides dedicated to pointers as well and maybe
  creating libraries. The presentation is really just meant to introduce club members to arduino programming, and I
  may add a recorded video of myself presenting this to the club as well.
