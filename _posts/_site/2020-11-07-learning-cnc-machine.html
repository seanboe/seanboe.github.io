<p>The Coronavirus quarantine period was a terrible time for many people, but I tried to use it to my advantage by completing something I hadn't had the time for: a mini CNC/milling machine.</p>
<p>In 7th grade, my dad and I began working on the machine but ended up not being able to finish adding the electronics because we ran out of time.
  We followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHl9UwlDZbE&list=PLktKi_COpyPRd8JZfjhskWSvsFN3Cb1v8" title="Wikipedia: Fox">Nikodem Bartnik's DIY dremel cnc design</a> because he did a
  phenomenal job of creating an effecting cnc/milling machine at a low cost.
</p>

<p>My first job was finding a feasible gcode sender. Nikodem recomended GRBL controller and CNCjs. Neither worked for me; 
  GRBL controller didn't work at all and I couldn't find support for it, and while CNCjs is a very powerful software with good reviews, I didn't want to install nodejs for one application. Instead,
I found a simple google chrome browser extension that did the trick. Here's a video of my first tests: </p>
